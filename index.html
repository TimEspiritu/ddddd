      <div class="col sm-3 bg-primary text-white p-3 m-3"><strong>😋Food and Water Container🥤 </strong>
        <p>Water and food are essential for human survival, with water being crucial for bodily functions like nutrient transport and temperature regulation, and food providing the energy and building blocks for growth and repair. Both are vital for health, but the body can survive longer without food than without water, which is essential for life and found in every cell. </p>  
      </div>
      <div class="col sm-3 bg-danger text-white p-3 m-3"><strong>⛑️First Aid Kit🦺</strong>
        <p>A first aid kit is crucial for providing immediate care for injuries and illnesses, preventing minor issues from becoming severe, and potentially saving lives. It allows for quick and appropriate treatment, which can stop blood loss, prevent infection, and reduce the risk of complications. The ability to handle common emergencies promptly can significantly improve recovery time and is essential for peace of mind in homes, cars, and workplaces.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col sm-3 bg-warning text-white p-3 m-3"><strong>🔦Flashlight and Whistle😮‍💨</strong>
        <p>A flashlight and whistle are crucial emergency tools for signaling for help and improving visibility. A flashlight provides light to see hazards and signal in the dark, while a loud whistle requires less energy than shouting and can be heard over long distances, with three blasts being a universal distress signal. Both are essential for personal safety, especially after a natural disaster or when outdoors. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col sm-3 bg-success text-white p-3 m-3"><strong>👕Extra Clothes👖</strong>
        <p>Clothing is important because it provides protection from the elements and hazards, fulfills social and cultural needs like modesty and identity, and allows for personal expression and confidence. Beyond basic survival, clothing serves as a vital tool for social interaction and self-representation.  </p>
